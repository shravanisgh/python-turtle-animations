# Python Turtle Animations

This repository contains a small collection of creative animations built using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
The focus of this project is to practice Python fundamentals, mathematical visualization, and creative coding through visual patterns.

## Files Included

- `heart.py` — Red heart animation using mathematical functions  
- `rbg heart.py` — Rainbow heart using HSV → RGB color transitions  
- `spiral.py` — Circular spiral pattern with color gradients  
- `flower.py` — Geometric flower-style design using rotation and symmetry  

---

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- turtle (standard Python module)  
- colorsys  
- math

## How to Run the Project
### Step 1: Install Python
1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
2. Download Python 3.x for your operating system  
3. During installation, **check the box**:  
   → *Add Python to PATH*

After installation, open Command Prompt / Terminal and verify:
```bash
python --version
You should see a Python 3.x version.

Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Download and install VS Code

Open VS Code after installation

Step 3: Open the Project Folder in VS Code
Download or clone this repository from GitHub

Open VS Code

Click File → Open Folder

Select the folder that contains these files:

heart.py

rbg heart.py

spiral.py

flower.py

Step 4: Run an Animation
In VS Code, open any file (for example: heart.py)

Open the terminal inside VS Code:

Press: `Ctrl + `` (backtick)

Run the file using:

bash
Copy code
python heart.py
For the other animations, run:

bash
Copy code
python "rbg heart.py"
python spiral.py
python flower.py
Each command opens a new window and displays the animation.
